# Melt: a Lightweight Faceswap GUI

Melt is a powerful faceswapping tool that allows users to easily swap the faces of multiple videos. Its graphical user interface makes it easy for anyone to use, regardless of their technical expertise. The tool also includes a queue system, which allows users to add multiple videos to be processed in a row. This can save time and effort when working with a large number of videos. In addition to its user-friendly interface and queue system, Melt also utilizes multiprocessing to swap faces in multiple videos simultaneously. This helps to speed up the face swapping process, making it possible to process a large number of videos in a short amount of time. Whether you are a professional video editor or just looking to have some fun with face swapping, Melt is a tool that is worth trying out.
